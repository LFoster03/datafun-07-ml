## Install and Run
- Create a GitHub project repository with a default README.md. 
- Clone the repository down to the machine into the Documents folder. 
- Open the repository folder in VS Code. 
- In VS Code, add a .gitignore file, a requirements.txt, and a python folder with imports.
- Create virtual environment with python3 -m venv .venv.
- Then activate the virtual environment with source .venv/bin/activate.
- Install the imports: jupyterlab, numpy, pandas, pyarrow, matplotlib, seaborn, and scipy in the terminal.
- Commit these changes to the remote repository using
`git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push`

## Start a New Jupyter Notebook
- Create a new notebook in your repository.
- In a Markdown cell at the top of the notebook, add: title, author, date and a clickable link to the GitHub project repository.
- In a Python cell just after, add all import statements, organized following standard conventions. 
- Run the notebook and Git add / commit / push changes to GitHub.
